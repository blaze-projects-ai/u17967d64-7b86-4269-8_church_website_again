        <p>Grace Community Church was founded in 1952 by a small group of families who gathered in a living room with a shared vision: to build a community rooted in faith, compassion, and service. What began as a humble prayer group of twelve has grown into a thriving congregation of over 500 members.</p>
        <p>Over the decades, we've weathered storms, celebrated milestones, and witnessed countless lives transformed by the power of God's love. In 1968, we moved into our current building on Faith Avenue, and in 2015, we completed a major renovation to better serve our growing church family and community.</p>
        <p>Today, Grace Community Church continues the legacy of those founding families — welcoming all who seek a deeper relationship with God and a community to call home.</p>

          "To know Christ and to make Him known — through worship, fellowship, discipleship, and service."
        </blockquote>
        <p>We exist to glorify God by making disciples who love God, love people, and serve the world. Everything we do flows from this mission — from our Sunday worship services to our community outreach programs.</p>
